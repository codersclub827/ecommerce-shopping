### 📥 Step 1: Clone the Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/codersclub827/forever-shopping.git
cd forever-shopping
```

### 📦 Step 2: Setup Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a .env file in the /backend directory:

```bash
MONGODB_URL = your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY = your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_SECRET_KEY = your_cloudinary_secret_key
CLOUDINARY_NAME = your_cloudinary_name
JWT_SECRET = your_jwt_secret
ADMIN_EMAIL = "admin@example.com"
ADMIN_PASSWORD = "admin123"
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = your_stripe_secret_key
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET = your_rasorpay_key_secret
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID = your_rasorpay_key_id
PORT=5000
```

Run the backend server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Now Backend will run on like http://localhost:5000

### 💻 Step 3: Setup Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

Create a .env file in the /frontend directory:

```bash
VITE_BACKEND_URL= your_backend_url_port
VITE_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID = your_razorpay_key_id
```

Now Frontend will run on like http://localhost:3000

### ☁️ Step 4: MongoDB Atlas Setup (Free Cloud DB)

1. Visit: https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register
2. Create a Free Shared Cluster
3. Create a DB user (e.g., e-commerce)
4. Whitelist IP Address → Allow Access from Anywhere (0.0.0.0/0)
5. Click Connect → Connect your application
6. Copy your Mongo URI Like :
   ```bash
   mongodb+srv://demo:kjkfldjskdljfkls@er4ere.dfdf.hdfkjhsdfhd/jlkjfdklsjdklf?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   ```
7. Paste it into your .env file as MONGO_URI

### 🔐 Step 5: Admin Setup


Option 2: Promote Your Own Account

1. Register a new user on the frontend

2. Go to MongoDB Atlas → Cluster → Collections → users

3. Find your user and update the role like:

   ```json
   {
     "role": "admin"
   }
   ```

4. Save and re-login — you now have admin access

**🎯 Done! Your full-stack e-commerce site is now running locally 🚀**
